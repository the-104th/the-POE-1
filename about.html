    <P>Ruby Pictures was founded in 2023 by a group of passonate photographers who shared a vision to <b>make professional photography accessible to everyone</b>, regardless of their financial background or social status.</P>
    <p>The idea was sparked when the founder, <b>Ruby Dlamini</b>, noticed a growing gap in the photography industry. High-quality photography was often viewed as a luxury service, leaving many without the oppotunity to capture their most important milestones. Ruby wanted to change that.</p>
    <p>What started as a small side project in Ruby's home studio in <b>Johannesburg</b> quickly evolved into a <b>community-focused</b> photography business. The company built its reputation on <b>inclucivity, affordability and creativity</b>, offering personalized packages to suit different needs from intermate family shoots and graduations to large weddings and corporate events.</p>
    <p>Ruby Pictuers thrives on the belief that <b>every story deserves to be told beautifully</b>. the team takes pride in working with people from all walks of life, making every client feel comfortable and confident in front of the camera. Today, Ruby Pictures is mor than a company it is a movement that want to democratize photography.</p>
    <p><b>Core Values:</b></p>
